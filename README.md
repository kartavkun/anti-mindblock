# anti-mindblock for Linux

A tool for osu! standart mode to prevent mindblocking for Linux.

Original idea was taken from [this](https://github.com/ShikkesoraSIM/anti-mindblock) project.

Actually, I just rewrote it and ported it to Linux :)

## Installation
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Kartavkun/anti-mindblock/releases/latest).

I don't want to write README for projest that's not ready yet...
